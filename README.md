# MTOPAPER
Project file for development.
CURRENT ERRORS/FIXES NECESSARY!!!:
(1)Login sign up buttons: Modal needs to be universal
(2)Need to edit the bottom section on the homepage: images appear massive.
(3)On the Credibility page need to center the input box and text.
(4)Need to edit sliders on the word count page right now they look atrocious.
(5)For the 'Start Essay' segment I forgot to add a proceed button. 
(6)Basically have to go through every one and make the frontend look better. Some are better
than others but for the most part the text looks jarring and out of place and must be re-formatted to look nicer.
